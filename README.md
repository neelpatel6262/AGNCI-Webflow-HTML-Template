🌐 AGNCI – Webflow HTML Website Template

I recently started learning HTML, CSS, and responsive design properties. To practice and strengthen my skills, I picked up the AGNCI Webflow template and recreated it using pure HTML, CSS, and responsive principles.

Instead of exporting from Webflow, I used the VisBug extension to inspect elements and rebuild the layout from scratch. This project helped me improve my understanding of clean code, responsiveness, and professional web structure.

🧠 My Learning & Thought Process

I wanted to test my skills after learning HTML & CSS basics.

I used VisBug to analyze Webflow’s AGNCI template and then recreated it by hand.

This project gave me real practice in responsive design and taught me how to handle layouts more effectively.

⚠️ The responsive view is not yet perfect, but I gave my best effort and I’m continuously learning how to improve it.

My goal is to keep building more professional, real-world templates as I grow in web development.

📌 Future Improvements

Refine responsive layout for better mobile experience

Add smooth animations with CSS transitions

Explore integrating JavaScript functionality (navigation menu, sliders, etc.)
